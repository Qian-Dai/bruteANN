This is a Python implementation of nearest neighbor vector search using brute-force search and the PCA algorithm. 

If you want to run it locally, please follow these steps:

1.Download the .tar.gz dataset from the official website to the dataset folder, and run the unload.py script to extract the files.

2.The util folder provides correct Puthon implementations for reading fvecs and ivecs files.

3.You can adjust the number of nearest neighbor vectors in the main function.
